Automata Simulators In Javascript

This is simple series of algorithms to represent a simulation of finite state machines.

In the topic of Theory of Computation we have two types of machines to read patterns of Regular Languages,
the deterministic finite automata (DFA) and the nondeterministic finite automata (NFA or eFA for empty state).
